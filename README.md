# [Talek's AAC](https://subahokke.github.io/taleks-aac)
An Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) website custom-tailored to myself. 

It uses JavaScript's SpeechSynthesis function to read aloud pre-defined buttons, as well as custom text input. Buttons have simple images to display types of phrases/words. Feel free to use this as a template for your own if you would like! It's simple on purpose.
