                    <p id="info">this is an aac (augmentative and alternative communication) app/communication board made for myself. i am an autistic person who tends to go non-verbal in situations where i need to communicate with people. most of the other aac apps i've seen out there cost more money than i could feasibly ever afford for an app like this! so i decided to make my own. if you've somehow stumbled upon this without knowing who i am, welcome! feel free to use it for yourself too, although this is <i>very</i> tailored to myself. i wanted this to be very simple and easy to follow because i don't want to get even more overwhelmed just trying to use my own website to talk, as well as make it easy to copy for other people who need it to make their own using this as a template with minimal development knowledge. i'm also dyslexic, and i found that comic sans is a very easy font for me to read compared to most other fonts.<br><b>last updated: </b>january 22 2025</p>
